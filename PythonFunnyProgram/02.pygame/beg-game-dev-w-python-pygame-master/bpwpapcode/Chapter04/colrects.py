    Not all surfaces need to be locked. Hardware surfaces do (the screen is usually a hardware
    surface), but plain software surfaces do not. Pygame provides a mustlock method in surface
    objects that returns True if a surface requires locking. You could check the return value of
    mustlock before you do any locking or unlocking, but there is no problem in locking a surface that
    doesnâ€™t need it, so you may as well lock any surface that you plan on doing a lot of drawing to.
